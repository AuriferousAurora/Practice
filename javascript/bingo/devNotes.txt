So, I have the bones of a bingo game written. The next step is to determine what features need to be added so that I can determine what order to add them in and how to add them.

[X] I'll want to assign a player name to each board.

[ ] A big one is determining a winner. I wrote some code to determine a winner, but it's not currently functioning properly. I'll need to review it: method named 'checkForWin' on ln 70.

[ ] I need to write code to recursively check that the number I'm drawing is not in the array of previously drawn numbers.

[ ] I'm pretty sure the code that I wrote to exclude duplicate ranges is not correct. (lns 21, 158)

[ ] Obviosuly a UI would be great. It makes sense to use HTML/CSS for the UI since I can host it easily and maybe even teach my students how to do it (the more time I spend writing it, the harder it seems. Learning loops, functions, objects-- specifically class functions which return objects, and a few other concepts that I likely forgot seems like a lot, but who knows. They're smart).

[ ] At some point I need to go back and make sure that the code I wrote to generate ranges and to draw numbers isn't broken. I don't think it is, but I'm still only get like 75% of how that is happening.
